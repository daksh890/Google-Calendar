## About The Project.
#### This project is a clone of the Google Calendar, built usoing React-js, tailwind-css & materials-icons. 
### Styling Libraries 
#### In this project I have used <b>tailwind-css</b> for styling purpose. I have also used <i>materials-icon</i> for styled icons.
### React Hooks
#### I have used react-hooks for composable and reusable code logic. 
- I have mainly used <b>useEffect</b> for Encapsulating Side Effects, <b>useState</b> to store state of variables, <b>useContext</b> to update state through children components and manage states globally, <b>useReducer</b> for managing calender events like create, update, delete event  & <b>useMemo</b> for establishing event filtering functionality.
- I have used Context-Wrapper.js file for establishing & managing all these functionality.
